//! Boot-time self-checks.
//!
//! The kernel cannot host `cargo test`: it is a `#![no_std] #![no_main]` binary,
//! and the in-QEMU test harnesses need nightly. So the checks that need a real
//! machine run here instead, on a kernel built with the `selftest` feature, and
//! report their verdict through [`debug_exit`](crate::arch::current::debug_exit).
//!
//! Everything here must be checkable *on the machine*. Anything that is pure
//! arithmetic belongs in a `libs/` crate with ordinary unit tests instead.
//!
//! Checks run against a fully booted kernel, so anything the boot path already
//! asserts is not repeated here — a rejected base revision panics long before
//! this, which the harness sees as a missing verdict.
