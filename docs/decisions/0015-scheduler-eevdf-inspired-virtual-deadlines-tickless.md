# D-15 Scheduler: EEVDF-inspired virtual deadlines, tickless

Status: Accepted, 2026-07-18.

**Decision.** Virtual-deadline fair scheduling (the EEVDF family Linux
adopted in 6.6), tickless idle (no periodic timer when nothing runs).
A pluggable-policy hook (sched_ext's lesson) is a cheap future door,
not a v1 feature.

**Rationale.** Modern fairness with modest implementation complexity;
zero idle wakeups serves the "lightweight" mandate directly.
