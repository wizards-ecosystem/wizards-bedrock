# D-34 A spin lock holds the interrupt flag

Status: Accepted, 2026-08-14. Amended by D-77.

**Context.** `001-boot.md` recorded the hazard when `SpinLock` was written: a
lock taken in ordinary kernel context and also taken from an interrupt handler
deadlocks, and on a single CPU that is a certainty rather than a race. Nothing
could reach it while interrupts were off. Slice 2 turns them on.

**Decision.** Acquiring a `SpinLock` clears `IF`; the guard restores what it
found on drop. Every lock in the kernel, not a second lock type.

**Rationale.** The fix belongs in the lock rather than at the call sites, which
is what the original note said. Restoring rather than enabling is what makes
nesting correct: an inner lock that saw the flag already clear puts back a clear
flag, so it cannot hand interrupts back while an outer section still holds one.
Release order is part of it — unlock, then restore, because the other order
opens a window in which an interrupt arrives at code still holding the lock.

Asterinas parameterises its lock over the guard discipline
(`LocalIrqDisabled`, `PreemptDisabled`). That distinction earns its keep once
there is a scheduler; until then it would be a type parameter with one useful
value.

**Consequences.**

- The surviving hazards are the entries `IF` does not mask: a fault can be
  raised while a lock is held, and an NMI can arrive at any time. So D-31's rule
  that a trap handler must not log still stands — for a narrower reason.
- Interrupt latency is now bounded by the longest critical section. Scrolling
  the framebuffer console holds a lock across a screenful of pixel copies.
  Acceptable with no scheduler; revisit with one.
- Recovery is private to `wost`'s non-returning panic boundary. Kernel panic
  reporting never waits for or forcibly releases a kernel lock; a busy output
  channel may be omitted.
